Master thesis: Revealing the dynamics of galaxy clusters with X-rays

Research work developed during the year 2010 at DARK cosmology, Niels Bohr Institute, Uni. Copenhagen

Abstract:

The study developed in this thesis concerns the dynamics of Galaxy Clusters. To estimate the total mass of a Galaxy Cluster we can rely on X-ray observations, and on the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium. Galaxy clusters are known to be powerful cosmological tools, and measuring the total mass of different Galaxy Clusters is crucial to give us information on some of the cosmological parameters. We propose a new method to constraint the Cluster's total mass from X-ray measurements, without relying on the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium. This method relates the dynamics of the gas with the dynamics of dark matter particles in a Galaxy Cluster, and allow us to layout the dynamical state of the cluster. We apply this method to X-ray measurements of the Cluster A2052 and we find the difference between the total mass measured with this method, and the mass measured under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, to be extremely significant. We also try to measure the gas velocity at the virial radius for this Cluster, and we constrain this to |vr| < (3.0 Â± 0.8) x 10^2 km/s.
