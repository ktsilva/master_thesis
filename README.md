**Master thesis: Revealing the dynamics of galaxy clusters with X-rays**

Research work developed during the year 2010 at DARK cosmology, Niels Bohr Institute, Uni. Copenhagen

**Abstract:**

The study developed in this thesis concerns the dynamics of Galaxy Clusters. To estimate the total mass of a Galaxy Cluster we can rely on X-ray observations, and on the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium. Galaxy clusters are known to be powerful cosmological tools, and measuring the total mass of different Galaxy Clusters is crucial to give us information on some of the cosmological parameters. We propose a new method to constraint the Cluster's total mass from X-ray measurements, without relying on the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium. This method relates the dynamics of the gas with the dynamics of dark matter particles in a Galaxy Cluster, and allow us to layout the dynamical state of the cluster. We apply this method to X-ray measurements of the Cluster A2052 and we find the difference between the total mass measured with this method, and the mass measured under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, to be extremely significant. We also try to measure the gas velocity at the virial radius for this Cluster, and we constrain this to |vr| < (3.0 Â± 0.8) x 10^2 km/s.

**Method:**

From observations of galaxy clusters in the X-rays spectral band, we have access to the gas' density and temperature profiles. Assuming the gas in the ICM to be in hydrostatic equilibrium and spherically distributed, the hydrostatic mass can be calculated. Usually one assumes that the hydrostatic mass is the total mass of the cluster, since the dynamical mass and the gravitational mass are just two different ways to get to the same physical result. We argue that it is possible for the dynamical mass to increase (or decrease) by a half of the hydrostatic mass. Our goal is to derive a method that give us the total mass of a cluster from X-ray measurements, without the usual assumption that the gas in the ICM is in hydrostatic equilibrium.

The Monte Carlo method takes the advantage of randomness. We choose to implementing the Metropolis Algorithm where we are capable of exploring the phase-space of configurations without getting trapped into local minima. The advantage of this algorithm is that we assign a probability of accepting a configuration even if it does not follow that chi2 is smaller than before. In our case, a configuration is defined by a random combination of the free parameters that define the bias function.
